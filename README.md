## Business Description
#### Freelancing club 
We the “Freelancing club” are small company founded in 2015 in Cottbus by a small group of graduates with different skills, points of view and a lot of passion to help people make their dreams come true – by getting things from other specialists done or by using their own diverse skills and getting paid for that what they desire and love to do anyway. 
In the last five years we growth steadily and fast. Now we want to get even bigger. 
The main idea of our company is to connect other companies, freelancers or normal people and get work done. As most of our freelancers work remotely, we have a big variety of tastes and ideas – so there is a piece of the “PIE” for everybody. From web developers, operating systems specialists and graphic designers to architects, handymen (able to repair everything with their magic hands) near you and woodworkers (making your dreamt furniture a real thing). And of course, we have a lot (you cannot even imagine how many) of these creative and skillful people waiting for YOU and your passion to make it a REALITY.

## Purpose of the app
As we have been seeing that we are growing faster than ever we decided to “pour more water” on our business so it will grow and become a bigger, stronger, and more beautiful (yeah exactly like a flower) than ever.
And when it comes to hiring SOMEONE, we want to hire someone like YOU – creative and one of a kind. We kindly invite you to join our community and make something more of your passion hidden in the shelf for so long and waiting to bloom again. 
We want from you to develop a web app – an app which should be used from people like you who want to work their dream job from everywhere in the world as well as from the people ”on the other side of the coin”– the one who already found their purpose in life and need things to be done for them the way they want it. We believe in YOU and your creative mind so we will let you do it yourself the way you want to see this app. We will list only some factors and main tasks which are important for us and our work – the rest depends only on you and your imagination.
